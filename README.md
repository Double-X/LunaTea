## RoadMap

1. Fully type the RPGMaker MZ core classes
2. Create a standard library for plugin & game creation
3. Create a pipeline for making plugins efficiently and distributing them effectively
4. Allow for backwards compatability with MV
5. Allow for debugging not seen in the production plugin builds
